rename "parameters" to "arguments" or maybe "operands"
maybe have each operation allowed to generate multiple opcodes and have "push {r1, r2, r3}" and "pop {r1, r2, r3}" or "push r1, r2, r3", "pop r1, r2, r3" (could maybe be done in hardware)

make string into expression

make memory clocked

use verilator

check register offset is correct bitlength

maybe have parameters all be expressions

expressions = arithemtic expression, string, register, register offset, indirect

maybe combine register and register-offset, i.e. register + 0 = register

make imports paths relative to the importees path instead of relative to where the assembler program is ran
in lib.rs there is a bunch of clones for the cache, maybe possible to reduce it
