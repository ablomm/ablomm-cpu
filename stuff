rename "parameters" to "arguments" or maybe "operands"

maybe have each operation allowed to generate multiple opcodes and have "push {r1, r2, r3}" and "pop {r1, r2, r3}" or "push r1, r2, r3", "pop r1, r2, r3" (could maybe be done in hardware)

make string into expression

make memory clocked

use verilator

maybe have parameters all be expressions

expressions = arithemtic expression, string, register, register offset, indirect

maybe combine register and register-offset, i.e. register + 0 = register

import aliasing

change condition names from les -> slte

make file cache key Intern<Pathbuf>

add notes to Error

combine ld and st to just mv

i.e. 
st r1, [addr];
mv [addr], r1;

ld r1, [addr];
mv r1, [addr];

have a cpu_mnomonic
and a asm_mnomonic
