maybe have each operation allowed to generate multiple opcodes and have "push {r1, r2, r3}" and "pop {r1, r2, r3}" or "push r1, r2, r3", "pop r1, r2, r3" (could maybe be done in hardware)

make memory clocked

use verilator

combine ld and st to just mv

i.e. 
st r1, [addr];
mv [addr], r1;

ld r1, [addr];
mv r1, [addr];

have a cpu_mnomonic
and a asm_mnomonic

show an error for each statement that has it instead of the first error

have times 1, and times 0 on register or register offset work and
have divide by 1 for register and register offset work

progress bar
